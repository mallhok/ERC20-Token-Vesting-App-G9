# ERC20-Token-Vesting-App-G9
Hackathon repository for Group 9: "ERC20 Token Vesting Application"


<br>1.	PROJECT PLANNING AND SCOPE DEFINITION:<br>
•	Objective: Define the goals and scope of the project, detailing the features and functionalities to be included in the ERC20 Token Vesting Smart Contract.<br>
•	Actions:Conducted a thorough analysis of project requirements, considering vesting cliffs, slicing periods, and revocation options.<br>

<br>2.	ENVIRONMENT SETUP:<br>
•	Objective: Set up the necessary development environment and tools for coding, testing, and deployment.<br>
•	Actions:<br>
•	Selected Remix as the primary development environment for writing and deploying Solidity smart contracts.<br>
•	Configured the environment to integrate seamlessly with Truffle for testing purposes.<br>
<br>3.	SMART CONTRACT DESIGN:<br>
•	Objective: Design the architecture and logic of the ERC20 Token Vesting Smart Contract, including key functions and data structures.<br>
•	Actions:<br>
•	Defined the structure of the smart contract, incorporating functions for vesting schedule creation, token calculation, beneficiary token collection, and schedule revocation.<br>
•	Implemented comprehensive error handling and edge case considerations.<br>
<br>4.	CODING IN SOLIDITY  ON REMIX:<br>
•	Objective: Wrote and deployed the smart contract code using the Solidity language within the Remix development environment.<br>
•	Actions:<br>
•	Coded the smart contract functions, ensuring alignment with the specified project requirements.<br>
•	Utilized Remix's real-time compilation and debugging features for efficient coding.<br>
<br>5.	TESTING ON REMIX:<br>
•	Objective: Execute initial testing on Remix to identify and address any syntax errors or logical issues.<br>
•	Actions:<br>
•	Performed unit testing for individual functions to verify correct behavior.<br>
•	Utilize Remix's testing environment to simulate various scenarios and validate contract functionality.<br>
<br>6.	INTEGRATION WITH TRUFFLE FOR AUTOMATION TESTING:<br>
•	Objective: Integrated the smart contract with Truffle for comprehensive automated testing using a testing framework.<br>
•	Actions:<br>
•	Configured Truffle for automated testing, developing a suite of test cases covering all contract functions.<br>
•	Executed automated tests to ensure the solidity of the smart contract, catching any unexpected behaviors.<br>
<br>7.	FRONTEND DEVELOPMENT:<br>
•	Objective: Develop a user-friendly frontend using HTML, CSS, and JS to interact with the smart contract.<br>
•	Actions:<br>
•	Created a visually appealing and intuitive interface for users to input parameters and interact with the smart contract functions.<br>
